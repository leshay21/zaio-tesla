# zaio-tesla
This is a clone of the original Tesla landing page that I recently did , it is my very first project as a developer.
I learned through a web development platform known as zaio.io 
We used html and css to make this project , the main aim of it was to get us in the motion of web devlopment and how different elements such as spans and divs are used as well as how we can go about styling our html.
The Zaio Tesla clone consists of 1 assets folder and 2 files named 'index.html' and 'styles.css'
We've also added a banner image and favicon image.It is really simple and is not mastered yet.
